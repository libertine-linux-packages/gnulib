# gnulib for Libertine Linux

## License

* The license for this package is MIT.
* The license for the upstream source is a motley mixture of GPL3, GPL2 and LGPL2.1 with dual licensing of some files and exemptions and exceptions. Do not use gnulib for your own code; it's a hideously broken concept with some pretty shaggy code.
